      "<p>As you explore the spider plot beneath the map, you see a clear pattern emerge. Domestic students, represented in orange, gravitate towards fields like Education, Architecture, Health, and Agriculture. Overseas students, depicted in green, are significantly present in Engineering Technologies, Management & Commerce, and Information Technology. The colors blend and spread across the spider web, visually narrating the preferences and distribution of student enrollments.</p>",
      "<p>Take your cursor to the spider graph and hover on solid circles in line with Engineering Technologies, you discover that 54% of enrollments are domestic students, while the remaining 46% are overseas students. Now hovering on Management & Commerce, you see that the ratios are slightly in favor of overseas students, who make up 55.7% of the total, and the rest 44.3% is occupied by domestic students. Information Technology stands out with overseas students dominating at 63.3%, leaving domestic students at 36.7%.</p>",

The total enrollment count rises from 1.0165 million to 1.0493 million, summing up to over 2 million students when combined with the year 2018. The line graph on the right confirms this increasing trend. The spider plot, however, remains consistent with minor variations, echoing the student enrollment trends from the previous year.</p>",
      "<h5>2020: The Pandemic Impact</h5>",
      "<p>As you slide into 2020, the pace of growth slows. The enrollment count edges up slightly to 1.0518 million. Here, the spider plot tells a subtle story â€“ a slight reduction in overseas enrollments contrasts with a steady rise in domestic enrollments. This subtle change hints at the impending disruptions.</p>",
      "<p>Hovering over the spider plot, you see the detailed impact. Domestic student enrollments continue to grow, while overseas enrollments show a slight decline. Despite these changes, the overall pattern remains the same as in 2018.</p>",
      "<h5>2021: The Crash</h5>",
      "<p>The year 2021 hits hard. Enrollment drops from 1.0518 million to 1.032 million. The global COVID-19 pandemic casts a long shadow over the educational landscape. Overseas student enrollments decline noticeably, while domestic enrollments manage a modest increase. The spider plotâ€™s colors show these changes, reflecting the resilience and adaptability of domestic students amidst the pandemic.</p>",
      "<p>Examining the spider plot closely, you see the effects of the pandemic. Overseas enrollments drop significantly, but domestic enrollments show a slight uptick. The total enrollment from 2018 to 2021 reaches 4.15 million, with domestic students continuing to dominate fields like Agriculture, Health, Architecture, Engineering, and Education, while overseas students maintain a strong presence in IT, Management & Commerce.</p>",
      "<h5>2022: A Continued Decline</h5>",
      "<p>Finally, moving to 2022, the narrative becomes clear. The enrollment count dips further to 1.0061 million, the lowest since 2018. The spider plot shows a continued decrease in overseas enrollments and a slight increase in domestic enrollments. Despite the overall drop in numbers, the pattern remains unchanged, domestic students continue to dominate fields like Health, Architecture, Agriculture, and Education, while overseas students prefer IT. Engineering Management & Commerce fields display balanced ratios, with overseas students slightly favoring Management & Commerce, and domestic students leaning towards Engineering.</p>",
      "<p>Hovering over the spider plot in 2022, you see the clear trends. Domestic students still prefer fields like Health, while overseas students dominate in IT. Engineering and Management & Commerce show nearly balanced ratios, with a slight edge for domestic students in Engineering and for overseas students in Management & Commerce.</p>",
      "<h5>Conclusion</h5>",
      "<p>From 2018 to 2022, Australia's enrollment landscape weaves a complex story of growth, resilience, and adaptation. With a total of 5.16 million enrollments, the trends show a peak in 2020, followed by a decline influenced heavily by global events. Domestic students predominantly choose Agriculture, Health, Education, and Architecture, while overseas students are drawn to IT, Engineering, and Management & Commerce. Explore this dashboard to see these trends and interact with the data for deeper insights into how they have changed over the years.</p>",
